BUDGET BLOX
============

This is a project dedicated to creating a new kind of personal budget app

-------------

I am currently at a crossroads with the GUI. I like, but I'm starting to notice some things I just don't like about it - especially when I am using it with mobile.

* It seems that there is an obvious focus on the transactions. Even from my first iterations of this, I have wanted the focus to be on the budgets. Even the current design in the way with which you add a transaction, the emphasis is set on the budget. In this light, I think I need to reorganize the app and really make the budgets the central focus.

* I don't like the modals. They take too long to open - they just don't feel responsive when I click on them. I want to switch this thinking to maybe a dropdown instead.

* Reorganizing the priority of budgets and banks on mobile devices is clunky. It's because on one hand, I have to make that area scrollable, but on the other hand, I need to make the object draggable. I'm thinking of forgoing the drag-and-drop functionality altogether and maybe make the budget/bank slide over a bit to reveal functions you perform on it

* Creating a transaction requires that a lot of fields be filled in. It's kind of ridiculous. I need to change how you create a transaction so that the budget will automatically be filled in... or something... I'm not sure... it just needs to be easier... maybe remove the idea of contacts and default to today?

* When creating a transaction, I also need to be able to easily split that transaction amoung multiple budgets in real-time... and it needs to show how much is left in each budget and, subsequently, each bank - all in real-time as you enter amounts. Various graphs might be useful for this.
