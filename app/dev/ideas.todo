 ☐ Show bank calculation on add/edit expense - change back-end to use this
 ☐ Edit expense
 ☐ Edit income
 ☐ Edit budget
 ☐ Delete expense
 ☐ Delete income
 ☐ Delete budget
 ☐ Delete bank
 ☐ Month/Year
 ☐ drag-and-drop budget offset
 ☐ drag-and-drop bank transfer
 ☐ drag-and-drop needs also to incorporate a limit transfer
 ☐ When adding a bank, show the bank list - same for budget
 ☐ Either Budgets OR Banks ALWAYS needs to be open
 ☐ I need to adjust the size of ui-sortable, which is only accessable as the .$el of the collection views
     However - this is pretty tricky because it shows height of 0 during render because the view hasn't
     been populated yet
 ☐ Redo all forms to make them responsive: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-sizes
 ☐ I want to change the pre-fill for the edit modals to be value instead of placeholders - this will likely affect the backend as well
 ☐ Consider using a different date picker - I like the full-screen date picker for mobile though
 ☐ The "today" date variable in server needs to be moved out of global scope - it doesn't update unless the server is restarted
 ☐ Grippy needs to be wider
 ☐ Blue selecty thing needs to be on right side of grippy... or actually... put it under grippy
